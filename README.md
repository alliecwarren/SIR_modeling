# SIR_modeling
Shiny application for SEIRD models for commonly vaccinated conditions

The shiny apps implement a basic SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model for various infectious diseases that are commonly vaccinated against. Initial parameters are taken from CDC sources and/or literature, but the app also allows the user to enter custom parameters.
